        <p class="meta">Last updated: 2026-03-24</p>
        <div class="card">
          <p>VedaSuite AI provides AI-powered competitor and refund intelligence for Shopify merchants, including fraud support, pricing guidance, shopper trust scoring, and profit insights.</p>
          <h2>Data We Process</h2>
          <p>Depending on merchant configuration and scopes, we may process store metadata, order and customer records, refund behavior, fraud-related signals, merchant-defined settings, and tracked competitor domains.</p>
          <h2>Anonymized Fraud Pattern Insights</h2>
          <p>If a merchant explicitly enables anonymized fraud pattern insights, VedaSuite AI limits that behavior to anonymized or pseudonymized fraud signals intended to reduce fraud and return abuse risk. Raw customer contact data is not exposed cross-merchant through this feature.</p>
          <h3>Categories of Data</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>merchant account and store installation information</li>
            <li>order, refund, fulfillment, and product records made available by Shopify</li>
            <li>customer identifiers and contact details required to power merchant workflows</li>
            <li>merchant-entered configuration settings and competitor tracking inputs</li>
            <li>security, diagnostics, audit, and support-related logs</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Purpose of Processing</h2>
          <p>We process data to operate the app, generate merchant insights, support billing, respond to support and compliance requests, and improve reliability and security.</p>
          <h2>Lawful and Operational Basis</h2>
          <p>Where applicable, we process data to provide the service requested by the merchant, meet platform and legal obligations, protect the service against fraud or abuse, and pursue legitimate operational interests such as reliability, security, and support.</p>
          <h2>Subprocessors and Service Providers</h2>
          <p>Data may be processed by infrastructure, hosting, storage, monitoring, analytics, communication, and support vendors acting on our behalf and under appropriate contractual or operational safeguards.</p>
          <h2>International Transfers</h2>
          <p>Data may be processed in jurisdictions other than the merchant's location. Where required, we rely on reasonable contractual, technical, and organizational measures to protect transferred data.</p>
          <h2>Retention and Compliance</h2>
          <p>We retain data only as needed to provide the service and satisfy legal or platform obligations. VedaSuite AI supports Shopify compliance flows for <code>customers/data_request</code>, <code>customers/redact</code>, and <code>shop/redact</code>.</p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational controls to protect data. No method of storage, processing, or transmission is guaranteed to be completely secure.</p>
          <h2>Merchant and Data Subject Rights</h2>
          <p>Merchants may contact us regarding access, correction, deletion, portability, or objection requests that relate to data processed through the app. We will respond as required by law and Shopify platform obligations.</p>
          <h2>Children's Data</h2>
          <p>VedaSuite AI is intended for business use by merchants and is not directed to children.</p>
          <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
          <p>We may update this policy from time to time to reflect operational, legal, or product changes. Material updates will be reflected by the updated date on this page.</p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>These terms terminate when the merchant uninstalls the app or when either party terminates access as permitted by law, platform policy, or these terms.</p>
          <h2>Governing Principles</h2>
          <p>These terms should be interpreted under applicable law and platform requirements. If a provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in effect to the maximum extent allowed.</p>
